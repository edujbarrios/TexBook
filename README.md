## 📝 Writing Your Book

### 1. `main.tex`

This is the main file where you compile your book. It includes the preamble and each chapter file.

```latex
\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{book}

\input{preamble}

\begin{document}

\frontmatter
\title{Title of the Book}
\author{Author of the Book}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\mainmatter
\include{chapters/chapter1}
\include{chapters/chapter2}

\end{document}
```

### 2. `preamble.tex`

This file contains your LaTeX package imports and configurations.
```latex
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{a5paper, inner=30mm, outer=25mm, top=25mm, bottom=30mm}

\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\thepage}
\fancyhead[LO,RE]{\leftmark}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.5pt}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true,
    linkcolor=blue,
    filecolor=magenta,      
    urlcolor=cyan,
}

% Configuración adicional para narrativa
\usepackage{setspace}
\setstretch{1.2} % Espaciado entre líneas ligeramente mayor

% Sin numeración de capítulos en la primera página del capítulo
\usepackage{titlesec}
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]
  {\normalfont\Huge\bfseries}{\chaptertitlename\ \thechapter}{20pt}{\Huge}
\titlespacing*{\chapter}{0pt}{50pt}{40pt}
```

### 3. `chapterX.tex`

```latex
\chapter{The Beginning}
In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing.
```
## 📝 Adding chapters

- Create a new chapter file in the `chapters/` folder, e.g., `chapter3.tex`.
- Write your chapter content in the new file.
- Include the new chapter in `main.tex`:
```latex
  \include{chapters/chapter3}
```
After that, create a `chapter3.tex` inside the `chapter` folder, and start writting the new chapter!

## 🚀 Compile Your Book
To compile your book as you are writting - to see how it's getting - run the following command in your terminal:

```latex
pdflatex main.tex
```
